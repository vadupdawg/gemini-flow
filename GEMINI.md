# Gemini Flow v1.0.0: Advanced AI Agent Orchestration Platform

## Introduction

Gemini Flow is a powerful orchestration platform that enables you to coordinate multiple AI agents to accomplish complex software development tasks. This document provides the necessary context for the orchestration system, outlining the available tools, workflows, and best practices to ensure efficient and effective multi-agent collaboration.

## Core Philosophy

Gemini Flow uses a multi-agent approach to solve complex software engineering tasks. Specialized agents, guided by specific prompts, work together to achieve a common goal. The `Orchestrator` manages the workflow, and the `Memory` component allows agents to share information.

## Quick Start

Get started in seconds with a single command:

```bash
npx gemini-flow@latest init
```

This will set up a new Gemini Flow project, including the necessary configuration files and prompt templates.

## Available Commands

### Core Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `init` | Initialize a new Gemini Flow project | `gemini-flow init` |
| `start` | Start the web monitoring UI | `gemini-flow start --port 3000` |
| `flow <prompt>` | Run a dynamic, to-do based workflow | `gemini-flow flow "build a REST API"` |
| `swarm <goal>` | Run a swarm of agents to achieve a high-level goal | `gemini-flow swarm "create a web app"` |
| `memory` | Manage the memory of the system | `gemini-flow memory set key value` |

### SPARC Development Modes

SPARC modes are specialized roles for agents. Each mode has a corresponding prompt file in `.gemini/prompts/modes` that defines its behavior, goals, and constraints.

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sparc run <mode> <prompt>` | Run a specific development workflow | `gemini-flow sparc run coder "implement user auth"` |
| `sparc modes` | List all available SPARC modes | `gemini-flow sparc modes` |

### Memory & Coordination

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `memory set <key> <value>` | Store information in the knowledge bank | `gemini-flow memory set user "auth with JWT"` |
| `memory get <key>` | Search stored information | `gemini-flow memory get user` |
| `memory list` | List all keys in the memory | `gemini-flow memory list` |

## SPARC Modes

Gemini Flow comes with a variety of pre-configured SPARC modes to accelerate your development process. These modes are designed to handle specific tasks within the software development lifecycle.

**Available Modes:**

*   `analyzer`: Analyzes code and provides insights.
*   `architect`: Designs system architecture and data models.
*   `batch-executor`: Executes a batch of commands.
*   `coder`: Implements features and writes code.
*   `debugger`: Helps debug code and identify issues.
*   `designer`: Designs UI/UX components.
*   `devops`: Manages infrastructure and deployments.
*   `documenter`: Generates documentation for code.
*   `innovator`: Generates new ideas and solutions.
*   `integration`: Integrates different parts of a system.
*   `memory-manager`: Manages the memory of the system.
*   `optimizer`: Optimizes code for performance.
*   `prompt-engineer`: Designs and refines prompts.
*   `researcher`: Conducts research on a given topic.
*   `reviewer`: Reviews code for quality and correctness.
*   `security-reviewer`: Audits code for security vulnerabilities.
*   `swarm-coordinator`: Coordinates a swarm of agents.
*   `tdd`: Implements test-driven development.
*   `tester`: Tests code for functionality and bugs.
*   `workflow-manager`: Manages and orchestrates workflows.

## Workflow Guidelines

1.  **Decomposition:** Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks.
2.  **Specialization:** Assign each task to the most appropriate agent (e.g., `architect` for design, `coder` for implementation).
3.  **Memory:** Use the `Memory` to store critical information, decisions, and artifacts that need to be shared between agents.
4.  **Iteration:** Start with a simple workflow and iteratively add complexity.

## Best Practices

*   Write clear and concise prompts for each task.
*   Ensure prompt files for SPARC modes are detailed and specific.
*   Use the web UI to monitor progress and identify bottlenecks.
