# Gemini Flow v2.0.0: Advanced AI Agent Orchestration Platform

## Introduction

Gemini Flow is a powerful orchestration platform that enables you to coordinate multiple AI agents to accomplish complex software development tasks. Powered by Google's Gemini AI, this framework provides comprehensive tools for multi-agent collaboration, task automation, and intelligent development workflows.

## Core Philosophy

Gemini Flow uses a multi-agent approach to solve complex software engineering tasks. Specialized agents work together through:
- **SPARC Development Modes**: 20+ specialized AI roles for different tasks
- **Swarm Coordination**: Orchestrated multi-agent collaboration
- **Persistent Memory**: Shared context and knowledge across sessions
- **Task Management**: Dependency tracking and workflow automation

## Quick Start

Get started in seconds:

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/vadupdawg/gemini-flow.git
cd gemini-flow
npm install && npm run build

# Set your API key
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Run your first command
./gemini-flow --help
```

### Memory Management

Persistent storage across sessions:

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `memory store <key> <value>` | Store information | `./gemini-flow memory store "api_spec" "REST API v2"` |
| `memory get <key>` | Retrieve information | `./gemini-flow memory get "api_spec"` |
| `memory list` | List all stored keys | `./gemini-flow memory list` |
| `memory export <file>` | Export memory to file | `./gemini-flow memory export backup.json` |
| `memory import <file>` | Import memory from file | `./gemini-flow memory import backup.json` |
| `memory stats` | Show memory statistics | `./gemini-flow memory stats` |

### Agent & Task Management

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent spawn <type>` | Create new agent | `./gemini-flow agent spawn researcher --name "analyzer"` |
| `agent list` | List active agents | `./gemini-flow agent list` |
| `task create <type>` | Create new task | `./gemini-flow task create "research" "Analyze competitors"` |
| `task list` | List active tasks | `./gemini-flow task list` |

## SPARC Modes

Gemini Flow comes with a variety of pre-configured SPARC modes to accelerate your development process. These modes are designed to handle specific tasks within the software development lifecycle.

**Available Modes:**

*   `analyzer`: Analyzes code and provides insights.
*   `architect`: Designs system architecture and data models.
*   `batch-executor`: Executes a batch of commands.
*   `coder`: Implements features and writes code.
*   `debugger`: Helps debug code and identify issues.
*   `designer`: Designs UI/UX components.
*   `devops`: Manages infrastructure and deployments.
*   `documenter`: Generates documentation for code.
*   `innovator`: Generates new ideas and solutions.
*   `integration`: Integrates different parts of a system.
*   `memory-manager`: Manages the memory of the system.
*   `optimizer`: Optimizes code for performance.
*   `prompt-engineer`: Designs and refines prompts.
*   `researcher`: Conducts research on a given topic.
*   `reviewer`: Reviews code for quality and correctness.
*   `security-reviewer`: Audits code for security vulnerabilities.
*   `swarm-coordinator`: Coordinates a swarm of agents.
*   `tdd`: Implements test-driven development.
*   `tester`: Tests code for functionality and bugs.
*   `workflow-manager`: Manages and orchestrates workflows.

## Workflow Guidelines

1.  **Decomposition:** Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks.
2.  **Specialization:** Assign each task to the most appropriate agent (e.g., `architect` for design, `coder` for implementation).
3.  **Memory:** Use the `Memory` to store critical information, decisions, and artifacts that need to be shared between agents.
4.  **Iteration:** Start with a simple workflow and iteratively add complexity.

## Best Practices

*   Write clear and concise prompts for each task.
*   Ensure prompt files for SPARC modes are detailed and specific.
*   Use the web UI to monitor progress and identify bottlenecks.
