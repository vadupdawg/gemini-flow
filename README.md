# Gemini Flow üöÄ

**A hobby project exploring the power of Gemini AI and Claude Code**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This project is heavily inspired by and based on [Claude Flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-code-flow). It's a personal experiment to test the capabilities of Google's Gemini AI using similar patterns and concepts. This is NOT an official project and should be viewed as a learning exercise and tribute to the excellent work done on Claude Flow.

## About This Project

Gemini Flow is an experimental port of Claude Flow's concepts to work with Google's Gemini AI. It demonstrates how powerful AI orchestration patterns can be adapted across different AI providers. This project exists to:

- Test Gemini AI's capabilities in multi-agent scenarios
- Explore AI orchestration patterns
- Learn from and appreciate the architecture of Claude Flow
- Provide a playground for experimenting with AI-driven development workflows

## üåü Features

- **20+ SPARC Development Modes**: Specialized AI agents for coding, testing, debugging, architecture, and more
- **Multi-Agent Swarm Coordination**: Orchestrate multiple AI agents working in parallel
- **Persistent Memory System**: Store and retrieve context across sessions
- **Task Management**: Track and manage complex workflows with dependencies
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor agent activities and system status
- **MCP Integration**: Connect with Claude Code to leverage Gemini's 1M token context window
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new commands, modes, and capabilities

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- npm or yarn
- Google Gemini API key

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### From GitHub

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vadupdawg/gemini-flow.git
cd gemini-flow

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Set up your Gemini API key
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Run Gemini Flow
./gemini-flow --help
```

### Quick Setup Script

```bash
# One-liner installation
git clone https://github.com/vadupdawg/gemini-flow.git && cd gemini-flow && npm install && npm run build
```

## üîë Configuration

### API Key Setup

Gemini Flow requires a Google Gemini API key. Set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Or create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### Optional: Add to PATH

For global access, add the gemini-flow directory to your PATH:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/gemini-flow"
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Show all available commands
./gemini-flow --help

# Check system status
./gemini-flow status

# List available SPARC modes
./gemini-flow sparc modes
```

### SPARC Development Modes

Run specialized AI agents for different tasks:

```bash
# Run the default orchestrator mode
./gemini-flow sparc "Build a REST API with authentication"

# Run specific SPARC modes
./gemini-flow sparc run coder "Implement user authentication"
./gemini-flow sparc run tester "Write unit tests for auth module"
./gemini-flow sparc run architect "Design microservices architecture"

# Test-Driven Development mode
./gemini-flow sparc tdd "Shopping cart feature with checkout"
```

### Multi-Agent Swarm Coordination

Coordinate multiple agents for complex tasks:

```bash
# Research swarm
./gemini-flow swarm "Research modern web frameworks" \
  --strategy research \
  --mode distributed \
  --max-agents 5 \
  --parallel

# Development swarm
./gemini-flow swarm "Build e-commerce platform" \
  --strategy development \
  --mode hierarchical \
  --max-agents 8 \
  --monitor

# Analysis swarm with output
./gemini-flow swarm "Analyze codebase performance" \
  --strategy analysis \
  --output json
```

### Memory Management

Store and retrieve information across sessions:

```bash
# Store data
./gemini-flow memory store "project_specs" "E-commerce platform with React and Node.js"

# Retrieve data
./gemini-flow memory get "project_specs"

# List all stored keys
./gemini-flow memory list

# Export memory for backup
./gemini-flow memory export backup.json

# Import memory from file
./gemini-flow memory import backup.json
```

### MCP Integration with Claude Code

Bridge Gemini's 1M token context window with Claude Code:

```bash
# Start MCP server to expose Gemini capabilities
./gemini-flow mcp start

# Connect to Claude Code
./gemini-flow mcp connect

# Collaborative analysis (Gemini + Claude)
./gemini-flow mcp collaborate "Analyze this large codebase" --directory ./src

# The workflow:
# 1. Gemini processes full context (up to 1M tokens)
# 2. Claude refines the analysis
# 3. Get combined insights from both models
```

See [MCP Integration Guide](docs/MCP_INTEGRATION.md) for detailed setup.

### Agent Management

```bash
# Spawn a new agent
./gemini-flow agent spawn researcher --name "market_analyst"

# List active agents
./gemini-flow agent list
```
